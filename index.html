	<h1>Welcome To The Adhar Project</h1>
	<p class="bgstyle">Mental illness affects one in four people at any point in time and the impact touches every person in society. 
	There is a wide spectrum of conditions, including anxiety, addiction, obsession, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, personality disorder, phobia or an eating disorder.</p>
	<p class="bgstyle">Adhar Project is committed to helping people with these conditions as well as their families, carers and health professionals. We have 30 years of experience in 
	helping Adults and Families live healthier, happier, and productive lives.</p>
	<p class="bgstyle">You can find out more on our Help & Information page. 
	It also provides information for families, friends and carers, as well as an overview of our talking treatments.</p>

	<h1>Why Your Mental Health Is Important?</h1>
	<p class="bgstyle">Mental health is just as important as physical illness. We seek medical attention and treatment for any form of physical illness, or disease, but why do we neglect mental illness? One major reason is the stigma associated with the mental illness, 
	which can be social stigma or the perceived stigma/self-stigma.</p>
	<p class="bgstyle">One great way to overcome this is by acknowledging the importance of mental health and well-being and talking about anxiety, depression, distress or any other form of mental illness. Take the first step towards eliminating the stigma and improving yourself, just talking to one person (be it your parents, partner, siblings or any friend) who stands by you can get rid of worries and gives you strength, so next time don’t feel alone, 
	and talk to the person who’s really close to you, we’re all in this together .</p>

	<h1>What Should I Do?</h1>
	<p class="bgstyle">It's ok if you have any sort of mental health problem. The best thing you can do is to let someone know as soon as possible. 
	Early prevention and intervention can help treat the issue and stop from developing into a more serious concern.</p>
